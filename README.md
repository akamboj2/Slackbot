ECE 110 Honors Lab Project:

Purpose:
The goal of this project is to make moving things easier. This entails creating a robot that can carry your stuff around and follow you. This could be very helpful for people who may need help carrying their things, such as handicapped, elderly people or lazy people.

Background Research:
We looked at similar projects online for design inspiration. Currently, there arenâ€™t any autonomous robots that can help people with carrying they possessions. We want to provide people with such a device, without making it too expensive.
